# Keep My Resolution

## Whatawhy
This is a mod for RoR2 that prevents the game from changing your resolution, leaving you in full control. I made this for myself, 'cause i'm tired of the game randomly resetting the resolution to 1080p. My pc is potato, it can't run that!!!!

## Setup
Install the mod, run the game, then go to Mod Settings in settings and find this mod. Then you can change the resolution to the one you desire. The description provides the list of all available resolutions. Alternatively you can change the config found at BepInEx/config/InkyaRev.KeepMyResolution.cfg.
