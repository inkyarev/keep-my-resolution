# Keep My Settings

## Whatawhy
This is a mod for RoR2 that prevents the game from changing your settings, leaving you in full control. 

Currently, it supports:
- Gameplay
  - Keeping Damage Numbers
  - Keeping Exp and Money Effects
- Audio
  - Keeping Master Volume
  - Keeping SFX Volume
  - Keeping Music Volume
- Video
  - Keeping Resolution
  - Keeping FPS Limit

I made this for myself, 'cause i'm tired of the game randomly resetting the resolution to 1080p. My pc is potato, it can't run that!!!!

## Setup
Install the mod, run the game, then go to Mod Settings in the game's settings and find this mod. Then you can change the supported settings to what you desire. The description provides necessary information for filling them out. Alternatively you can change the config found at BepInEx/config/InkyaRev.KeepMySettings.cfg.
